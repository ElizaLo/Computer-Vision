# Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo, license plates in cars...) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast)
